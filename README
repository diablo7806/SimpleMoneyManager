Simple Money Manager.

Free and open source expense tracker for any PHP (7.4.3 was the environment developed and tested in) enabled web server. It's advantage of a web script 
over an app is global accessibility toanything with a web browser. Most suited for someone with a self-hosted server, "Home Lab".

Simple to use, works basically out of the box with only 1 configuration detail really needed, the address to be hosted on. SMM is a single file 
application plus the database and configuration file it generates, by default in the same directory as the script as smm.json.

Improvements will come as they come. I'm a mere hobbyist programmer computer nerd with a wife and kid.

Any feedback welcome.
